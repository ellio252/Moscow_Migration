    <h1 style="text-align:center">The Long History of Migration to Moscow</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size:18px">In less than 100 years, the population of Moscow grew by over 10,000,000 people. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Moscow’s population was 1,800,000, but one century later, the city’s population had surpassed 12,000,000. Extensive rural to urban migration is hardly a uniquely Soviet phenomenon, and scholars have often linked these migration patterns to waves of industrialization. Changes in population size, the creation of new types of employment, and technological developments have fed urbanization around the world since the beginning of Britain’s Industrial Revolution through the present day. Moscow’s initial population surge began in the imperial period as a result of the emancipation of the serfs but skyrocketed during the Soviet period. While urbanization in Moscow and across the Soviet Union for that matter may share a great deal in common with other countries, the realities and intricacies of Soviet socialism shaped the experience of migration to Moscow for most of the twentieth century.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size:18px">Migration from the Russian countryside to Moscow steadily increased following the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. Although the serfs technically gained the full rights of citizenship, serfs needed to make redemption payments to the nobility from whom they had been freed. Such payments required cash, and thus, free peasants sought out work in factories and workshops in Moscow and St. Petersburg to buy their land from their former owners. An internal passport system and the social and economic importance of the peasant communes governed migration in the Russian Empire. Since the time of Peter I (Peter the Great), all subjects needed to apply for a permit to travel, even for movement over short distances for a limited period of time. The cost of these documents was prohibitive, curbing large-scale migration. Following emancipation, peasants continued to face restrictions on mobility. Some relocated to Moscow illegally, while others applied for the appropriate temporary documents. The rule of the commune kept even those who moved to the city tied to their communities in the countryside. The commune relied on migrants’ remittances, and networks of fellow villagers functioned social surveillance for those living away from home. Women also moved to the cities both to support their families and find increased freedom away from fathers and husbands. In the early twentieth century, migration to the city became easier. Following the Revolution of 1905, peasants no longer needed to make redemption payments and the Stolypin land reforms made for easier migration.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size:18px">The First World War brought even more migrants to the cities. As with the other belligerent nations, the need for weapons and artillery created a demand for factory workers in urban centers. The wartime increase in urban populations coupled with the disruption and destruction of the empire’s transportation system resulted in food shortages. Most famously, shortages of bread in the then capital of Petrograd (St. Petersburg) incited a protest led by women tired of waiting in line for bread that habitually failed to materialize. When factory workers from the nearby Putilov Factory joined the women and soldiers refused to fire on the protestors, the February Revolution was born. The October Revolution followed, but the ensuing Civil War and famine depleted the urban populations of Moscow and Petrograd. Starving and in search of food, urban dwellers tried their luck in the countryside. Moscow became little more than a ghost town, and the proletariat, in whose name the Bolshevik Revolution had been waged, had almost entirely disappeared along with the industries that they had manned.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size:18px">Not even Moscow’s new status as capital of the Soviet Union, enacted in March 1918, helped bolster its population, but by the time of the first all-Union census in 1926, Moscow had surpassed its 1916 population by approximately 200,000 people. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) which made concessions to bourgeois practices. Specialists from the imperial period trained Soviet ones. Peasants worked their own farmland, while petty tradesmen were allowed to conduct business.</p>
